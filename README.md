Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)


# Brief Introduction

## My name is Zhuyin(Adrianne)  Li, a macss-econ student. I have a lot of hobbies, including hiking, biking, cooking as well as painting. I am also very keen on animals, especially dogs. Below is the picture of my own puppy, her name is **_Honey_**.

## In addition, this is one of my paintings:

## I have completed my undergraduate studies at the University of International Business and Economics, and during the time of my undergraduate stage I have developed a rather strong interest in the field of macroeconomics as well as econometrics. :thumbsup:

[The lady tasting tea](https://rkbookreviews.wordpress.com/2009/01/19/the-lady-tasting-tea-visual-summary/)
## One of my favourite books, which has enlightened me a lot in terms of how statistics can change the world and how people working in this field developed the sequence of most significant theories we are familiar with today.


# Summary

## It is a rather interesting experience to learn about markdown. Altough I have written some README files in my undergraduate stage, most of them are set in the format of text or word since I did not have a frequent interaction with github. However, I do realized that README file is of great importance for the usage of code, not only for the purpose of giving others instrucion, but also as a critical record of the aurthor's own coding process.
## For today's homework, I have learnt something new operations of writing markdown files, including inserting pictures, adding links and adopting different symbols while constructing a README.md file.
## Besides, after writing this md file by my own, it suddenly occurred to me that various studying materials I have used before were created as a README.md file (For instance, the syllabus of MACSS math camp: [MACSS math camp](https://github.com/jmclip/MACSS_math_camp)) and the markdown file can be really helpful.
